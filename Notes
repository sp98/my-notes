Container notes:

- a away be able to run a process in isolation. 
- We can run multiple processes inside an OS. Sometimes we want to run a process in a sandbox environment where its not aware of the other processes in the OS
- Sandboxing a container?
    -  The container has its own process namespace. 
    -  the container has cgroups (adding resource limits and certain capabilities)

- Definition: A container is a way to run a process in a sandboxed/isolated environment which can only see the processes running the same container (not those running on the OS)
              A container is a sandbox for a process. 
- Typically a container has one main process that is tied to the container lifecyle itself. When this process ends, the container stops. (this is - The container process and the container life cycle are tightly coupled)
- But we can run other process inside the contianer as well. 




Container Image: 
- Its similar to a notation of classes in OOP. 
- An image is like a class or template of something and we can create a number of instances (called containers) out of that image.
